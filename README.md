# JavaScript-Form-Validation

- Many websites utilize form validation for client-side validation of user details, card details, address details, and other information.
- If a mandatory input field name exists, the user can type a number, leave the field blank, type only one letter, and so on.
- All of these validations are simple to implement using JavaScript.
